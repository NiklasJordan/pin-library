The city relies heavily on annual monsoon rains to replenish the four water reservoirs that represent the main water resources for the public and extensive automotive industry in the region. Mismanagement of the water resources, combined with 3 years of deficient monsoon rainfall seasons prior to the event caused a dramatic depletion of the water reservoirs [related article](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-48672330). Additionally, the groundwater aquifer was drained beyond its usual recovering capability threshold because residents reverted to groundwater extraction via [bore wells](https://www.indiawaterportal.org/topics/borewells-and-tubewells). The three *Sentinel-2 L2A*-based Moisture index images from before, while and after the drought, show the desiccation of the Red Hills Reservoir over the heat period in 2019 with a clearly retreating water line.
