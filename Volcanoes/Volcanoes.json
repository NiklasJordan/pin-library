        "description": "[Mount Etna](https://www.britannica.com/place/Mount-Etna) on the Italian island of Sicily is the highest active volcano in Europe. At the moment it reaches a height of 3320 meters (changes due to depositions from eruptions and collapses of the crater) and covers an impressive area of 1600 km<sup>2</sup>.  Its lower slopes host vineyards, olive groves, and orchards. Surrounding the foot of the volcano several smaller and bigger settlements can be found. Mount Etna is currently and through the centuries very active only in the last five year having had four strombolian eruptions."

        "description": "[Stromboli](https://www.volcanodiscovery.com/stromboli.html) has been active consistently for at least 2000 years, which is unusual among volcanoes.  Most of its activity consists of brief and smaller bursts of lava 100-200 meters high into the air. Occasionally, longer periods of eruptions occur, lasting from a few to up to 10 years. The most recent one began in December 2002 and ended in July 2003. Although Stromboli's eruptions are not dangerous for the most part, more violent eruptions that take lives and destroy property, do occur. In [July 2019](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-48857422), a hiker died during the eruption, several people were injured and many had to flee to the sea. The deadliest [eruption in 1930](http://www.geo.mtu.edu/volcanoes/boris/mirror/mirrored_html/STROMBOLI-1930.html) took 6 lives and caused considerable damage."

In its heart lie two volcanic lakes, formed some 3.500 years ago, as the eruptions removed rock material and created a crater. The lakes are supplied by rain and hot springs."
