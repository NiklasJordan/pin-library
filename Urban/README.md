## Included pins 

### Venice, Italy

[<img src="fig/Venice_thumbnail.jpg" align="right" width="240">](https://www.flickr.com/photos/sentinelhub/50083026626/in/album-72157714991542468/)[Venice](https://www.britannica.com/place/Venice/Lagoon-and-tides), a so called island city with the population of [637,245](https://worldpopulationreview.com/world-cities/venice-population/), remains a major Italian port and is one of the world’s oldest tourist and cultural centres. The lagoon's mud banks, shallows, and channels are a source of income from marine and bird life and from salt pans. The lagoon has served as protection and as a natural sewerage system.
The deepening of channels in the 20th century, the overextraction of fresh water from mainland aquifers, the rising of the Adriatic Sea, and the geologic sinking of the Po River basin have lowered the land level, creating a serious flooding problem. On a regular basis, when high tides combine with winds from the south and east, the waters of the lagoon rise and flood the city, making Venice to be known as the [City built on water](https://www.livitaly.com/how-was-venice-built/). 

### Giza, Egypt

[<img src="fig/Giza_Urban_thumbnail.jpg" align="right" width="240">](https://www.flickr.com/photos/sentinelhub/50312332646/in/photostream/)Giza, located within the [Greater Cairo metropolitan area](http://www.newgeography.com/content/002901-the-evolving-urban-form-cairo), is the third-largest city in Egypt with 9 million inhabitants. The city is famous for its archaeological sites, in particular the [Great Sphinx](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Great-Sphinx) and the [Giza Pyramid Complex](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/history/archaeology/giza-pyramids/), which includes the Great Pyramid, the only one of the [Seven Wonders of the Ancient World](https://www.ancient.eu/The_Seven_Wonders/) still standing. The Great Pyramids are easily identifiable in satellite images thanks to their shadows cast to the North West contrasting with the brightly illuminated South sides. The distinct delineation between the arid [Sahara desert](https://www.livescience.com/23140-sahara-desert.html) to the West and the city of Cairo, with its green parks and golf courses, to the East is striking. Today, Giza is a rapidly growing region of Cairo, and the soaring population is leading to new construction of housing and roads encroaching on the desert hills.

### Lagos, Nigeria

[Lagos](https://www.britannica.com/place/Lagos-Nigeria), Nigerian city and chief port, is dominated by a system of islands, sandbars, and lagoons. The highest elevation point in Lagos is only 22 feet above sea level. The port of Lagos serves as the principal outlet for Nigeria’s exports, with the Lagos metropolitan area being a major educational and cultural centre. The main business district occupies Lagos Island’s southwestern shore and contains an increasing number of multistory buildings. This is the heart of the city, the centre of commerce, finance, administration, and education. The principal manufacturing industries in Lagos include the production of electronics equipment, automobile assembly, food and beverage processing, metalworks, and the production of paints and soap. The original settlement on the northwestern tip of Lagos Island is now a slum area characterized by narrow streets, poor housing, and overcrowding. 

### Kinshasa, DR Kongo

[<img src="fig/Kinshasa_thumbnail.jpg" align="right" width="240">](https://www.flickr.com/photos/sentinelhub/50315902121/in/album-72157715855028651/)
[Kinshasa](https://www.britannica.com/place/Kinshasa/Cultural-life), formerly known as Léopoldville, is the largest city and capital of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The city’s inhabitants are popularly known as Kinois. Kinshasa is the most important consumer centre of the republic and the core of its industrial and commercial activity. The city serves as the headquarters of major public corporations and of privately owned industrial and commercial companies. Among Kinshasa’s main industries are food processing and those producing consumer goods, generally for domestic markets. The rapid expansion of Kinshasa’s population has created serious problems in supplying the city with food; there is a constant threat of shortages, posing an implicit political problem as well. The poor forage at a considerable distance for firewood and keep gardens where they can find good soil. The demands of this vast urban population have caused extensive erosion in the surrounding countryside, as the soil is exhausted from overcultivation and trees cut for charcoal have not been replanted. The administration is unable to provide adequate services such as running water, electricity, and sanitation throughout the city. Medical facilities, like other city services, are overwhelmed by population growth; the same problem is present for the primary and secondary education system as well.
