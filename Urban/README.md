## Included pins 

### Venice, Italy

[<img src="fig/Venice_thumbnail.jpg" align="right" width="240">](https://www.flickr.com/photos/sentinelhub/50083026626/in/album-72157714991542468/)[Venice](https://www.britannica.com/place/Venice/Lagoon-and-tides), a so called island city with the population of [637,245](https://worldpopulationreview.com/world-cities/venice-population/), remains a major Italian port and is one of the world’s oldest tourist and cultural centres. The lagoon's mud banks, shallows, and channels are a source of income from marine and bird life and from salt pans. The lagoon has served as protection and as a natural sewerage system.
The deepening of channels in the 20th century, the overextraction of fresh water from mainland aquifers, the rising of the Adriatic Sea, and the geologic sinking of the Po River basin have lowered the land level, creating a serious flooding problem. On a regular basis, when high tides combine with winds from the south and east, the waters of the lagoon rise and flood the city, making Venice to be known as the [City built on water](https://www.livitaly.com/how-was-venice-built/). 

### Giza, Egypt

[<img src="fig/Giza_Urban_thumbnail.jpg" align="right" width="240">](https://www.flickr.com/photos/sentinelhub/50312332646/in/photostream/)Giza, located within the [Greater Cairo metropolitan area](http://www.newgeography.com/content/002901-the-evolving-urban-form-cairo), is the third-largest city in Egypt with 9 million inhabitants. The city is famous for its archaeological sites, in particular the [Great Sphinx](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Great-Sphinx) and the [Giza Pyramid Complex](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/history/archaeology/giza-pyramids/), which includes the Great Pyramid, the only one of the [Seven Wonders of the Ancient World](https://www.ancient.eu/The_Seven_Wonders/) still standing. The Great Pyramids are easily identifiable in satellite images thanks to their shadows cast to the North West contrasting with the brightly illuminated South sides. The distinct delineation between the arid [Sahara desert](https://www.livescience.com/23140-sahara-desert.html) to the West and the city of Cairo, with its green parks and golf courses, to the East is striking. Today, Giza is a rapidly growing region of Cairo, and the soaring population is leading to new construction of housing and roads encroaching on the desert hills.

### Lagos, Nigeria

[<img src="fig/Lagos_thumbnail.jpg" align="right" width="240">](https://www.flickr.com/photos/sentinelhub/50309178783/in/album-72157715855028651/)
[Lagos](https://www.britannica.com/place/Lagos-Nigeria), Nigerian city and chief port, is dominated by a system of islands, sandbars, and lagoons. The highest elevation point in Lagos is only 22 feet above sea level. The port of Lagos serves as the principal outlet for Nigeria’s exports, with the Lagos metropolitan area being a major educational and cultural centre. The main business district occupies Lagos Island’s southwestern shore and contains an increasing number of multistory buildings. This is the heart of the city, the centre of commerce, finance, administration, and education. The principal manufacturing industries in Lagos include the production of electronics equipment, automobile assembly, food and beverage processing, metalworks, and the production of paints and soap. The original settlement on the northwestern tip of Lagos Island is now a slum area characterized by narrow streets, poor housing, and overcrowding. 

### Kinshasa, DR Kongo

[<img src="fig/Kinshasa_thumbnail.jpg" align="right" width="240">](https://www.flickr.com/photos/sentinelhub/50315902121/in/album-72157715855028651/)
[Kinshasa](https://www.britannica.com/place/Kinshasa/Cultural-life), formerly known as Léopoldville, is the largest city and capital of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The city’s inhabitants are popularly known as Kinois. Kinshasa is the most important consumer centre of the republic and the core of its industrial and commercial activity. The city serves as the headquarters of major public corporations and of privately owned industrial and commercial companies. Among Kinshasa’s main industries are food processing and those producing consumer goods, generally for domestic markets. The rapid expansion of Kinshasa’s population has created serious problems in supplying the city with food; there is a constant threat of shortages, posing an implicit political problem as well. The poor forage at a considerable distance for firewood and keep gardens where they can find good soil. The demands of this vast urban population have caused extensive erosion in the surrounding countryside, as the soil is exhausted from overcultivation and trees cut for charcoal have not been replanted. The administration is unable to provide adequate services such as running water, electricity, and sanitation throughout the city. Medical facilities, like other city services, are overwhelmed by population growth; the same problem is present for the primary and secondary education system as well. 

### Altai, Mongolia

[<img src="fig/Altai_thumbnail.jpg" align="right" width="240">](https://www.flickr.com/photos/sentinelhub/50312752622/in/album-72157715855028651/)
With a population of about 15,800, Altai is one of the smallest provincial capitals in one of the least densely populated provinces, Govi-Altai. Govi-Altai is situated in the western part of Mongolia and is the countries second largest province (aimag). The majestic peaks of the Mongol Altai mountains stretch from North to South through its territory. The province was named after the Gobi Desert and the Mongol Altai Nuruu range, which virtually bisects the province to create a stark, rocky landscape. Most of the population live in the north-east corner, where melting snow from the Khangai Nuur feeds small rivers, creating vital water supplies. Gobi-Altai is one of the least suitable areas for raising livestock, and therefore one of the most hostile to human habitation. The average height is 1940 m high above sea level. The climate is capricious with winter temperatures as low as -30°C and summer temperatures up to 34°C. Despite the harsh conditions, the province is home to rare large mammals, such as Ibex, snow leopards, the Govi Bear, wild Bactrian camel, Argali sheep, black-tailed gazelle, and other wild cats. Province territory has many national parks, strictly protected areas, nature reserves and national monuments, protecting several animal species and providing a home to rare wildlife sanctuary.

### Nuuk, Greenland

[<img src="fig/Nuuk_thumbnail.jpg" align="right" width="240">](https://www.flickr.com/photos/sentinelhub/50312961127/in/album-72157715855028651/)
Located only 150 miles south of the Arctic Circle, at the mouth of a group of fjords, Nuuk is the capital, main port and a largest city of Greenland. It contains almost a third of Greenland's population, counting 18,326 people. Nuuk is the seat of government and is the country's largest cultural and economic centre, containing Supreme court, foreign consulates, a university, vocational training schools, a hospital, and radio and television stations. Important economic activities include government administrative work, education, health care, and other services, as well as hunting, fishing, fish and shrimp processing, and shipbuilding and repair. The city attracts [tourists]( https://www.tripadvisor.com/Tourism-g295112-Nuuk_Sermersooq_Municipality-Vacations.html) as it's the perfect starting point for a whale-watching trip, a dog-sled ride, or glacier exploration. Daily flights bring visitors to a land that has been inhabited for over 4000 years. The National Museum and Archives exhibits collections of rare Norse and Inuit archaeological artifacts, while the Katuaq Cultural Centre provides a showcase for contemporary Greenlandic art and music.

### Bagdhad, Iraq

[<img src="fig/Bagdhad_thumbnail.jpg" align="right" width="240">](https://www.flickr.com/photos/sentinelhub/50312474042/in/album-72157715855028651/)
[Baghdad](https://www.britannica.com/place/Baghdad/History), capital of Iraq, is situated in the heart of ancient Mesopotamia and holds most of Iraq’s manufacturing, finance, and commerce. The vast majority of the population, counting more than 7,5 million people, is Muslim and Arab. The government is the city’s principal employer, with hundreds of thousands of citizens working in the civil service, in government-run educational institutions, and in government-owned industrial and commercial enterprises. Bagdhad has long been an active cultural centre for the Arab world, producing prominent sculptors, painters, poets, and writers. In 8th to 9th centuries, it flourished into an [unrivaled intellectual center](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baghdad) of science, medicine, philosophy, and education and had the largest selection of books in the world. It was likely the largest city in the world containing over a million inhabitants at its peak. It began to decline in the "Iranian Intermezzo" of the 9th to 11th centuries, and was destroyed in the Mongolian invasion in 1258. Baghdad regained prominence only when it became the capital of Iraq in 1920; over the next half century, the city took on all the characteristics of a modern metropolis. The city was heavily damaged by aerial bombardment during the Persian Gulf War and again by air and ground operations during the Iraq War. During the interwar period the city’s services and infrastructure deteriorated badly because of inattention and economic sanctions. In recent years, it found itself the victim of several attacks, especially from al-Qaeda and its successor, the Islamic State. 

### Tabriz, Iran

[<img src="fig/Tabriz_thumbnail.jpg" align="right" width="240">](https://www.flickr.com/photos/sentinelhub/50315139303/in/album-72157715855028651/)
[Tabriz](https://www.britannica.com/place/Tabriz), the fourth largest city of Iran and capital of the East Azerbaijan province, counts almost 1400,000 inhabitants. The name Tabrīz is said to derive from tap-rīz (“causing heat to flow”), from the many thermal springs in the area. Iran is prone to earthquakes as it sits on [major fault lines](https://www.rferl.org/a/earthquake-hits-northwest-iran-tabriz/30259208.html) and experiences an average of one earthquake a day. Consquently, Tabriz, which lies about 1,367 metres above sea level, is prone to frequent and deadly earthquakes, which cause serious damages and casualties. The city has been occupied several times throughout history. The modernization of Tabrīz has quickened since World War II, with streets widened, buildings erected, and public gardens laid out with fountains and pools. The city’s newer buildings include a railway station and Tabrīz University. The city is commercially important, with the principal products including carpets, textiles, cement, agricultural machinery, motorcycles, and household appliances. The city is linked by rail with Tehrān and with areas to the north, and it has an airport.

### Washington D.C., USA

[<img src="fig/Washington_thumbnail.jpg" align="right" width="240">](https://www.flickr.com/photos/sentinelhub/50316019157/in/album-72157715855028651/)
[Washington D.C](https://www.britannica.com/place/Washington-DC) is the capital city of the United States of America. It is coextensive with the District of Columbia (the city is often referred to as simply D.C.) and is located on the northern shore of the Potomac River. In 1790 the U.S. Congress established a 260-square-km territory to serve as the permanent seat of the federal government. The territory was later named the District of Columbia, within which the city of Washington was built.  After the American Civil War (1861–65), the city of Washington expanded beyond its originally planned boundaries and became legally indistinguishable from the District of Columbia. Washington, D.C., remains a territory, not a state, and since 1974 it has been governed by a locally elected mayor and city council over which Congress retains the power of veto. The Washington metropolitan area covers nearly 10,360 square km and encompasses 10 counties. As a result of Washington’s abundance of federal civil service jobs and its status as a major tourist destination, the city’s economy is overwhelmingly dominated by the service sector. Research and development work is another key component of the local economy with most businesses linked to the federal government. Though it’s a bustling city, Washington, D.C., has lots of [wildlife](https://kids.nationalgeographic.com/explore/states/washington-dc/), such as Virginia opossums, groundhogs, brown bats, flying squirrels. The city is a home to bird species like a bald eagle, cardinals, great blue herons, and the official bird, the wood thrush. 

### Tel Aviv, Israel

[<img src="fig/TelAviv_thumbnail.jpg" align="right" width="240">](https://www.flickr.com/photos/sentinelhub/50311880368/in/album-72157715855028651/)
[Tel Aviv](https://www.britannica.com/place/Tel-Aviv-Yafo/History) is a major city and economic centre of Israel. The city was founded in 1909 as a Jewish garden suburb of the ancient port of Jaffa, with which it was later joined. By the beginning of the 21st century, the modern city of Tel Aviv had developed into a major economic and cultural centre. Tel Aviv forms the core of Israel’s largest metropolitan area, representing more than two-fifths of Israel’s population. Tel Aviv is depicted as the city “that never stops,” a thriving, vibrant, modern, dynamic, and multicultural city, one generally characterized as tolerant, secular, and liberal, while also materialistic and hedonistic city of the present. Jews represent the vast majority of Tel Aviv’s population. Tel Aviv forms the core of Israel’s postindustrial, globally oriented economy with almost one-sixth of all jobs in Israel located in the city. Nearly all banks and insurance companies operating in the country are headquartered in the city, and Israel’s only stock exchange is located there as well. As Israel’s most prominent centre of culture and entertainment, Tel Aviv is home to most of the country’s theatres and a New Israeli Opera. More than one-third of all performances and exhibitions in Israel are held in Tel Aviv, and the city hosts three of Israel’s eight largest museums.

### Seoul, South Korea

[<img src="fig/Seul_thumbnail.jpg" align="right" width="240">](https://www.flickr.com/photos/sentinelhub/50316144047/in/album-72157715855028651/)
[Seoul](https://www.britannica.com/place/Seoul), the capital of South Korea, is the cultural, economic, and political centre of the country. The area of the city has been inhabited by humans for thousands of years. The site was originally used for military purposes, with the remains of the fortifications now a popular attraction. The service sector employs the largest proportion of the city’s workforce, with information technology and electronics industries highly developed. One of the biggest challenges of the city is overpopulation. With more than 10 million people living within 234 square miles, Seoul is one of the most populous cities in the world and one of the [most connected](https://ourworld.unu.edu/en/is-seoul-the-next-great-sharing-city). It has a highly-developed tech infrastructure, widespread public wifi, and 60 percent of South Koreans own a smartphone. To battle urban sprawl and overpopulation issues, Seoul built many residential buildings, an extensive subway system and set up a greenbelt around a large part of the city’s perimeter, which prohibits further extension of the built-up area. As a result, urban sprawl has extended to places outside the greenbelt, creating new residential areas in suburbs and satellite cities. 

### Ptuj, Slovenia

[<img src="fig/Ptuj_thumbnail.jpg" align="right" width="240">](https://www.flickr.com/photos/sentinelhub/50312694362/in/album-72157715855028651/)
Ptuj is the oldest town in Slovenia, dating back to the Stone Age. Due to its strategic location along a prehistoric trade route between the Baltic Sea and the Adriatic, it became an important center and legion-camp of the Ancient Romans. This is also how it got its name - the romans named it Poetovium. It is forbidden to dig deeper than 1 meter as the grounds below Ptuj still hide some valuable remnants of the old times. The town is dominated by the castle, standing proudly on the hill above Ptuj. Its strategic position at the bank of Drava river allowed the castle hill to be occupied since the early days of Ptuj and to keep an important role over the centuries. The look of the building we can see now dates back to the 18th century and is home to the museum that hosts the biggest collection of music instruments in the whole country. Ptuj is the center place of a carnival in the spring, an ancient rite of spring and fertility, called Kurentovanje. [Kurent](http://www.kurentovanje.net/en/the-kurent/) is a figure dressed in sheep skin who goes about the town wearing a mask, a long red tongue, cow bells, and multi-colored ribbons on the head. Organized in groups, Kurents go through town, from house to house, making noise with their bells to symbolically scare off evil spirits and the winter. Kurent has been recognized by [UNESCO](https://www.slovenia.info/en/places-to-go/regions/thermal-pannonian-slovenia/ptuj) for its unique cultural heritage. Each year, more than [100,000](https://govorise.metropolitan.si/dogodki/pustovanja-2019-po-sloveniji-od-povorke-v-ptuju-do-priljubljenega-cerknega/) people gather for the largest carnival in the country.
