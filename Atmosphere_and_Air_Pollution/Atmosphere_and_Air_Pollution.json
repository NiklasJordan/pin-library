        "description": "The Aerosol Index (AI) is a qualitative index indicating the presence of elevated layers of aerosols in the atmosphere. The main aerosol types that cause signals detected in the AI (because of their significant absorption) are desert dust, biomass burning and volcanic ash plumes. An advantage of the AI is that it can be derived for clear as well as (partly) cloudy ground pixels. [More...](https://earth.esa.int/web/sentinel/technical-guides/sentinel-5p/level-2/aerosol-index)"

By measuring how much sunlight gets scattered by clouds back up into space, scientists can better understand how much [clouds influence Earth's climate](https://neo.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/view.php?datasetId=MYDAL2_M_CLD_OT). Optical thickness depends on the clouds [physical constitution](http://glossary.ametsoc.org/wiki/Optical_thickness) (crystals, drops, droplets), and form; the overall effect depends on the particles concentration, scatter parameter and phase function, as well as the vertical extent of the cloud.
